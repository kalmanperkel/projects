<h3>Computer programming</h3>

<div>
    <p>Computer programming (often shortened to programming or coding) is the process of designing, writing, testing, debugging,
        and maintaining the source code of computer programs. This source code is written in one or more programming languages.
        The purpose of programming is to create a set of instructions that computers use to perform specific operations
        or to exhibit desired behaviors. The process of writing source code often requires expertise in many different subjects,
        including knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms and formal logic.Related tasks include testing, debugging,
        and maintaining the source code, implementation of the build system, and management of derived artifacts such as machine code
        of computer programs. These might be considered part of the programming process, but often the term software development
        is used for this larger process with the term programming, implementation, or coding reserved for the actual writing of
        source code. Software engineering combines engineering techniques with software development practices.</p>

<h3>Quality requirements</h3>

<div>
    <p>Whatever the approach to development may be, the final program must satisfy some fundamental properties. The following properties are among the most important:
        Reliability: how often the results of a program are correct. This depends on conceptual correctness of algorithms, and minimization of programming mistakes, such as mistakes in resource management (e.g., buffer overflows and race conditions) and logic errors (such as division by zero or off-by-one errors).
        Robustness: how well a program anticipates problems due to errors (not bugs). This includes situations such as incorrect, inappropriate or corrupt data, unavailability of needed resources such as memory, operating system services and network connections, user error, and unexpected power outages.
        Usability: the ergonomics of a program: the ease with which a person can use the program for its intended purpose or in some cases even unanticipated purposes. Such issues can make or break its success even regardless of other issues. This involves a wide range of textual, graphical and sometimes hardware elements that improve the clarity, intuitiveness, cohesiveness and completeness of a program's user interface.
        Portability: the range of computer hardware and operating system platforms on which the source code of a program can be compiled/interpreted and run. This depends on differences in the programming facilities provided by the different platforms, including hardware and operating system resources, expected behavior of the hardware and operating system, and availability of platform specific compilers (and sometimes libraries) for the language of the source code.
        Maintainability: the ease with which a program can be modified by its present or future developers in order to make improvements or customizations, fix bugs and security holes, or adapt it to new environments. Good practices[15] during initial development make the difference in this regard. This quality may not be directly apparent to the end user but it can significantly affect the fate of a program over the long term.
        Efficiency/performance: Measure of system resources a program consumes (processor time, memory space, slow devices such as disks, network bandwidth and to some extent even user interaction): the less, the better. This also includes careful management of resources, for example cleaning up temporary files and eliminating memory leaks.</p>
</div>

<h3>Readability of source code</h3>

<div>
    <p>In computer programming, readability refers to the ease with which a human reader can comprehend the purpose, control flow, and operation of source code. It affects the aspects of quality above, including portability, usability and most importantly maintainability.
        Readability is important because programmers spend the majority of their time reading, trying to understand and modifying existing source code, rather than writing new source code. Unreadable code often leads to bugs, inefficiencies, and duplicated code. A study[16] found that a few simple readability transformations made code shorter and drastically reduced the time to understand it.
        Following a consistent programming style often helps readability. However, readability is more than just programming style. Many factors, having little or nothing to do with the ability of the computer to efficiently compile and execute the code, contribute to readability.[17] Some of these factors include:
        Different indent styles (whitespace)
        Comments
        Decomposition
        Naming conventions for objects (such as variables, classes, procedures, etc.)
        The presentation aspects of this (such as indents, line breaks, color highlighting, and so on) are often handled by the source code editor, but the content aspects reflect the programmer's talent and skills.
        Various visual programming languages have also been developed with the intent to resolve readability concerns by adopting non-traditional approaches to code structure and display. Integrated development environments (IDEs) aim to integrate all such help. Techniques like Code refactoring can enhance readability.</p>

<h3>Algorithmic complexity</h3>

<div>
    <p>The academic field and the engineering practice of computer programming are both largely
        concerned with discovering and implementing the most efficient algorithms for a given class of problem.
        For this purpose, algorithms are classified into orders using so-called Big O notation, which expresses resource use,
        such as execution time or memory consumption, in terms of the size of an input. Expert programmers are familiar with
        a variety of well-established algorithms and their respective complexities and use this knowledge to choose algorithms
        that are best suited to the circumstances.</p>
</div>

<h3>Methodologies</h3>

<div>
    <p>The first step in most formal software development processes is requirements analysis, followed by testing to determine value modeling, implementation, and failure elimination (debugging). There exist a lot of differing approaches for each of those tasks. One approach popular for requirements analysis is Use Case analysis. Many programmers use forms of Agile software development where the various stages of formal software development are more integrated together into short cycles that take a few weeks rather than years. There are many approaches to the Software development process.
        Popular modeling techniques include Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD) and Model-Driven Architecture (MDA). The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a notation used for both the OOAD and MDA.
        A similar technique used for database design is Entity-Relationship Modeling (ER Modeling).
        Implementation techniques include imperative languages (object-oriented or procedural), functional languages, and logic languages.</p>
</div>

<h3>Measuring language usage</h3>

<div>
    <p>It is very difficult to determine what are the most popular of modern programming languages. Methods of measuring
        programming language popularity include: counting the number of job advertisements that mention the language,
        the number of books sold and courses teaching the language (this overestimates the importance of newer languages)
        , and estimates of the number of existing lines of code written in the language (this underestimates the
        number ofusers of business languages such as COBOL).
        Some languages are very popular for particular kinds of applications, while some languages are regularly
        used to
        write many different kinds of applications. For example, COBOL is still strong in corporate data centers
        often on large mainframe computers, Fortran in engineering applications, scripting languages in Web developmen
        t, and C in embedded software. Many applications use a mix of several languages in their construction and use.
        New languages are generally designed around the syntax of a prior language with new functionality added, (for example
        C++ adds object-orientation to C, and Java adds memory management and bytecode to C++, but as a result, loses efficiency
        and the ability for low-level manipulation).</p>
</div>

    <h3>Debugging</h3>

    <div>
        <p>
            Debugging is a very important task in the software development process since having defects in a program can
            have significant consequences for its users. Some languages are more prone to some kinds of faults because
            their specification does not require compilers to perform as much checking as other languages. Use of a static
            code analysis tool can help detect some possible problems.
            Debugging is often done with IDEs like Eclipse, Visual Studio, Kdevelop, NetBeans and Code::Blocks. Standalone
            debuggers like gdb are also used, and these often provide less of a visual environment, usually using a command line.
